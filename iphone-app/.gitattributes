# The line in .gitattributes treats your Xcode project file as a binary. This
# prevents Git from trying to fix newlines, show it in diffs, and excludes it
# from merges. Note that you will still see it shown as a conflict in merges,
# although the file wonâ€™t have changed. Simply commit it and things should be
# good.
